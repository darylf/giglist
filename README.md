> **:poop: I'm in the process of updating and modernizing this app! Assume it fails until further notice. :poop:**

Giglist is an online database for tracking concert data, written in Ruby on Rails. Still in its prototyping phase, it allows registered users to maintain a history of the bands they have seen live. Planned future enhancements include features to provide the touring history of popular bands, notify users about upcoming events, and connect users with new friends who have similar musical interests.
